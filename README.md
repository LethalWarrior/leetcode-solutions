# leetcode-solutions

This repo stores solutions of problems in leetcode that i attempted, as a part of my journey through learning `golang`. I will group the problems based on their difficulities, namely **easy**, **medium**, **hard**. The structure of the files in this repo will be like this:

```
easy
|--- <problem-name>
    |--- <problem-name>.go
    |--- <problem_name>_test.go
    |--- README.md
medium
|--- ...
hard
```
