# Leetcode Solutions

This repo stores solutions of problems in leetcode that i attempted, as a part of my journey through learning `golang`. I will group the problems based on their difficulities, namely **easy**, **medium**, **hard**. The structure of the files in this repo will be like this:

```
easy
|--- <problem-name>
    |--- <problem-name>.go
    |--- <problem_name>_test.go
    |--- README.md
medium
|--- ...
hard
```

## How To Use

go to the problem that you wanna see, and run `go test -v` on the _terminal_.You may also try to use the functions here by run them directly through the creation of `main.go` or some sorts. Feel free to add your own test cases, and report to me if the solution doesn't work.

## Note

> Please keep in mind that my solutions are not the optimized one. You may find the ones that are optimized in term of _time complexity_ and _space complexity_ while also applied _clean code principles_ somewhere out there. However, feel free to give suggestions to me as I may update the solutions here with the better ones later on :).
